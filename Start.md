### Quick Start

FilterLists is a directory of lists to which you can subscribe to block advertisements, malware, trackers, and annoyances. First, install one of the tools mentioned below under "Software Support." Then, you can subscribe to a set of these lists inside of that software to aid in protecting your privacy and security online. If you need help, open an [Issue](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/issues) and somebody will help you out.

### Legacy Site

This new version (2.0) of this site was launched on Jan. 28, 2017. While we continue to iron out the kinks, the legacy site is still live over at [v1.filterlists.com](https://v1.filterlists.com). Note that the legacy site is for archival purposes only and will no longer be updated.

### Background

Using a software firewall (adblocker) has become a key tool in protecting one's privacy online. While the current business model of the "free" Internet relies upon advertising revenue, publishers have become too flippant about tracking users without their consent. Advertising networks track users' browsing habits around the Internet building lucrative profiles to exploit for targeted marketing or big data research. Until Internet publishers develop more transparency or a new business model, we must continue to take the protection of our privacy into our hands.

Typical adblockers run as an extension in popular web browsers. As we browse the Internet, they compare HTTP requests to their list of hosts and filters to selectively block advertisements, trackers, and general annoyances. This filtering helps to protect the surfer's privacy, prevents [malvertising attacks](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/malvertising-is-cybercriminals-latest-sweet-spot/ "Why Malvertising Is Cybercriminals' Latest Sweet Spot - Wired"), and [reduces bandwidth requirements](http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/08/blocking-ads-can-cut-network-traffic-25-to-40-study-shows/ "Blocking Ads Can Cut Network Traffic 25% to 40%, Study Shows - VentureBeat"). Many contributors work hard to maintain these filter lists for anyone to use. Locating and selecting these lists, however, has not historically been very easy. **FilterLists is the independent and comprehensive directory of all public filter lists for advertisements, trackers, malware, and annoyances.**

### F.A.Q.

- _Is FilterLists essentially a fancy mirror of the Adblock Plus [Known Adblock Plus Subscriptions](https://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions "Known Adblock Plus Subscriptions") page?_<br>Yes and no. The information provided by FilterLists is very similar to the directory provided by Adblock Plus but aims to be more exhaustive, feature-rich, and up-to-date. The work that Eyeo (the company behind Adblock Plus) has and continues to do for the community is appreciated, but many disagree with Eyeo's decision to allow for paid whitelisting by major advertising and analytics platforms in their product. It could be a conflict of interest for Adblock Plus to be the primary host of an "all known" directory of filter lists, some of which may block advertisements from networks who have paid for whitelisting. To that end, there is a need for an independent directory to promote free choice by consumers. Adequate credit is given to Adblock Plus list maintainers via FilterLists, however; and no intentional intrusion or devaluation of their brand, products, or services has been performed.
- _Why did you build this site?_<br>The initial development of this site was a quick weekend project out of the core developer's personal desire for such a directory as he seeks to optimize his Internet privacy and safety. If it brings value to even one other Internet citizen, it was worth doing. Currently, no direct monetary gain is sought from the project.

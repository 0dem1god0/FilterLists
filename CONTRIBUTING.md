# What NOT to Contribute
Aside from the obvious (spam, self-promotion, etc.), please also do not submit issues related to the functionality of any particular list. FilterLists does not currently maintain or support any lists, so please take up functional issues with either the list or adblock software maintainers.

# What to Contribute
FilterLists aims to be a comprehensive and accurate directory of all active and stale lists. Please contribute information for lists that are not currently indexed as well as updated information for current lists.

The data that we index for each list is specified in the [json-schema](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/tree/master/json-schema) directory. When submitting a new list or updates to a current list, please provide values for all fields for which information is available.

# How to Contribute
If you are GitHub savvy, feel free to skip right ahead to a pull request. If not, please open a new issue with all of your proposed additions/revisions.

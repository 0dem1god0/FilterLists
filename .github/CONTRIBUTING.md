# How to Contribute to FilterLists

## Submitting or Updating Lists

We need contributors to help maintain this directory. Please submit [pull requests](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/issues) providing new or updated list information to ensure we have the most up-to-date information.

## Application Development

This project has mostly been a one-man side project. I have been working on rebuilding an API and web app on .NET Core to provide a slew of enhanced features to FilterLists users. If you want to jump in and contribute to the application development, I would love to have you join!
